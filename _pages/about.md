Currently, I am employed at the Environmental Change Institute (ECI), based at the University of Oxford, as a postdoctoral researcher. In my research, I mainly focus on the modelling of the economy-wide consequences of disasters on both a regional and interregional level, with a specific focus on industrial areas and critical infrastructure. In addition, I connect widely applied biophysical models to these macroeconomic models. Such integrated frameworks will allow for better evaluation of both current and future disaster risk, and will be of significant value in assessing the effects of disaster risk reduction measures and climate adaptation strategies.I have experience in modelling the effects of various disasters and extreme weather events, varying from hail and windstorms to floods and droughts. Due to the scope of my research, I have obtained a wide knowledge of input-output modelling, risk analysis, disaster impact analysis and geographic information systems (GIS).
