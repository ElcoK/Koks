Hi! Welcome to my personal page. You'll find here my CV, list of publications, the (GitHub) projects I am working on and (in due time) some useful blog posts related to python and geospatial analysis.

I am currently employed as a global infrastructure network analyst at the Environmental Change Institute, located at the University of Oxford. Over the past seven years I have worked on several topics related to disaster impact modelling, climate change and water economics in the context of national (ITRC-MISTRAL in the UK, Knowledge for Climate in NL) and EU research projects (ENHANCE and TURAS). I obtained a PhD in disaster impact modelling, an MSc in Spatial Economics (STREEM) and a BSc in Earth & Economics, all at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

My key research domain is the modelling of the economy-wide consequences of natural disasters on both a regional and interregional level, with a specific focus on industrial areas and infrastructure systems. In addition, one of the key elements in my research is to connect widely applied biophysical models to macroeconomic disaster impact models. I study the impact of a wide range of disasters, varying from large-scale floods to extreme weather events, such as extreme hail and wind storm events.
